# Why is "APK Easy Tools" here?

For some unknown reason, google sees APK Easy Tools as a violation to be hosted and shared, thus it is only avaliable for me and no one else,
I have moved the tool to the Github...

This tool is used for Tizen Users as it contains SHM installer...
WearOS Users do not need this...
