The main purpose of this Repo is to allow the SHM MOD Companion to read the Changelog, as I don't want to update the companion all the time just to update the Changelog...
But I decided to make it as an alternative presentation to XDA, It might be more organized here...

## What's SHM MOD \*gasp\*...?

Just kidding lol. Well, it's a tool for BP & ECG for Samsung Watches, but this tool has restrictions such as region lock and works only on Samsung Devices, and for that, I found it to be unfair; health is important, this tool should be accessible to everyone, it saves lives... Anyway, Install the MOD according to the Watch you own:
| Tizen (Active2 & Watch3 Only)  | WearOS (Watch4, Watch5 & Newer) |

## Pairing Problems with Huawei
Might work for others, China roms need to have google services, you can try installing WearOS by Google but don't use it

    Original Instructions:<br>
    You need Galaxy Wearables & Watch4 Plugin installed, now do the following steps:<br>
Download Samsung Health.<br>
start Samsung health, then go to accessories and search for your watch (scan).<br>
Samsung Health will call Galaxy Wearables to set up the connection, and a normal setup will be performed.</td>
				<td>This solution is provided by me:<br>
It was explained that you need to have the following apps installed:<br>
Galaxy Wearable & Watch 4 plug-in<br>
Give all permissions to Galaxy Wearables and the Watch4 plugin by going to app info, scroll down to permissions and grant all...<br>
Now Clear the data of the following applications:<br>
 - Google Play Services<br>
 - Google Play Framework<br>
 - Google Play Store<br>
 - HwWifiproBqeService (For Huawei devices only, skip if you are not Huawei)<br>

The phone will start acting up; that's normal, so restart your phone to allow the system app to rebuild itself. When the phone restarts, do not configure your google account yet, first try connecting to the Watch4 again through Samsung Health, and it should work, after that you can do whatever you want for google...<br>
<br>
One last note, disable any battery optimization; some phones have aggressive optimization, and they will kill background services which will stop the watch4 from pairing. If you can't disable it, then whitelist galaxy wearable and the watch4 plugin!</td>
