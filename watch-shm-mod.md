# 15th January 2024 - 1.2.5.002
 > Patch #1 - 26th Feb 2024 - Patched the service module, adding isRunning flag to the service module to check if service is running or not, and Added method StartService on MainActivity, this will ensure all services of SHM MOD on the watch are running (including IHRN), because of the flag isRunning, the Service will only start if it's not running (graceful handle)...

GUI:
 * ECG layout has been split into 2 layouts but nothing major...
 * Translations added: AS-IN (Assamese - India), BN-IN (Bengali), GU-IN (Gujarati - India), KN-IN (Kannada - India), ML-IN (Malayalam), MR-IN (Marathi - India), NE (Nepal), OR-IN (Odia or Oriya - India), SI (Sri Lanka), TA-IN (Tamil - India), TE-IN (Telugu - India), UR (Urdu) translations added by Samsung...

CODE:
 * CSCUtil,Adding countries back and defining them as EU_CSC & sEUCountry, but those values have no value or use, perhaps future update to utilize it...
 * Global Setting mode (detect theatre, bed time, kids mode and zen mode of the watch), possible use in the future?
 * They still show IHRN alert with sound and vibration, I have applied my fix (display correct message and silent the measuring notice)...

I still had to apply same patches for IHRN in Watch SHM:
 * Samsung IHRN auto-measurements were using wrong display messages (showing afib detected instead of auto measurement) and triggers sound + vibration notification every 10 minutes, I have fixed this by putting approprite message and set the notification as silent...

# History
> The updates here are for WearOS only, Tizen does not have much as it's compiled bin/lib file...
> Old History does not have detailed changelog, because I was only patching in the past

## 2023
### November 2023
 * 11th November 2023 - 1.2.2.005
---
 * a new layout added "BP not supported", this means BP will be controlled from the watch as well...
 * They added several messages "need a samsung device to uuse SHM", and "BP not approved in your region", also for calibratiion, they changed the message into "Wear your watch snugly, away from the wrist bone. Also, relax your hands and arms."
 * They added Device ID Service, probably to get the Device ID and not generate it randomly...
 * Well, the code i removed in SHM MOD 1.2.1.009, they have removed it in 1.2.2.005, this code was causing random crashes, this means my decision was correct...
 * IHRN on watch is heavily patched, hopefully it will stop IHRN suspending because the code looks promising now but I don't see any fix for the messages, vibrations and sounds... 
 * Chinese simplified has a custom icon for BP and ECG tiles...
 * Watch detects phone model, if not Samsung, show message "Samsung device required for using shm"
