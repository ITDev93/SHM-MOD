# 11th November 2023 - 1.2.2.005
 * a new layout added "BP not supported", this means BP will be controlled from the watch as well...
 * They added several messages "need a samsung device to uuse SHM", and "BP not approved in your region", also for calibratiion, they changed the message into "Wear your watch snugly, away from the wrist bone. Also, relax your hands and arms."
 * They added Device ID Service, probably to get the Device ID and not generate it randomly...
 * Well, the code i removed in SHM MOD 1.2.1.009, they have removed it in 1.2.2.005, this code was causing random crashes, this means my decision was correct...
 * IHRN on watch is heavily patched, hopefully it will stop IHRN suspending because the code looks promising now but I don't see any fix for the messages, vibrations and sounds... 
 * Chinese simplified has a custom icon for BP and ECG tiles...
 * Watch detects phone model, if not Samsung, show message "Samsung device required for using shm"

I still had to apply same patches for IHRN in Watch SHM:
 * Samsung IHRN auto-measurements were using wrong display messages (showing afib detected instead of auto measurement) and triggers sound + vibration notification every 10 minutes, I have fixed this by putting approprite message and set the notification as silent...
