# Current Known Bugs:
 * Watch SHM MOD - Due to Samsung using deprecated code, IHRN notification will randomly hang or be stuck, and they go away on their own when next IHRN is triggered, you can force remove it by toggling IHRN off and on again but it won't stop it from getting stuck again, you can ignore it, it has no battery impact...
